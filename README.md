## google CTF reverse engineering solution using Ghidra and ANGR + Claripy

After failing with basic `file` `strings` `grep` and `ltrace` commands on terminal

Firstly, we will use Ghidra to analyze the source code of the "a.out" executable.

<br />
1. Install Ghidra from the NSA's website : https://ghidra-sre.org/
  <br /> (make sure you have a JDK installed to run Ghidra)
  <br /> #Radare2 can also be used
<br />
2. Source code is extraced by disassembling using Ghidra. <br />
